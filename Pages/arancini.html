    <h2>Cook Time: 45 Minutes</h2>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup arborio rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (2 ounces)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded fontina cheese (2 ounces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the broth and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice, reduce the heat to low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Bring the broth and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice, reduce the heat to low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Combine the pine nuts, mozzarella, fontina and parsley in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then stir in the cooled rice, the parmesan and 2/3 cup breadcrumbs. Shape the mixture into sixteen 1 1/2-inch balls.</li>
        <li>Put the remaining breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl. Press your finger into the center of each rice ball, insert 2 teaspoons of the mozzarella mixture, then pinch the rice around the filling to enclose. Roll the balls in the breadcrumbs and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Loosely cover and refrigerate, at least 1 hour or overnight. (If refrigerating overnight, roll in more breadcrumbs before frying.)</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the rice balls, turning, until golden brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; season with salt.</li>
